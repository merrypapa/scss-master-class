- block has width and height but inline doesn't
- inline-block has the block property(height and width) also can put other element next to each other
2. Flexbox

- flexbox is not communicating with children -> needs flex container
- turn flex on -> display:flex
- flex direct -> row(default) / column
- justify-content: modify the position in main axis
- align-items: modify the position in cross axis
